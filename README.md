## Features ✨

- 🔄 Automatic conversion from SVG to React (JSX/TSX)
- 🎨 Maintains the original structure and style of the SVG
- 🚀 Support for JSX and TSX with auto-generated TypeScript definitions
- 💅 Handles inline styles and CSS classes
- 📝 Generates smart component names based on the file name
- 🔧 Zero configuration required!

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Locate the SVG file in your project
2. Rename the file from `.svg` to `.jsx` or `.tsx`
3. Voilà! Your React component is ready to use

## Quick Example 👁️‍🗨️

**Before (`icon.svg`):**

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="red" />
</svg>
```

**After (`Icon.jsx`):**

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

const Icon = (props) => {
  return (
    <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" {...props}>
      <circle cx={50} cy={50} r={40} fill="red" />
    </svg>
  );
};

export default Icon;
```

For TypeScript (`.tsx`), the component will include auto-typing!
